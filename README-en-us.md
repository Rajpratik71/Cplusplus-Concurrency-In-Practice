Writing Motivation
The book "C ++ Concurrency Programming Guide" is written by individuals in their spare time, due to time constraints, coupled with their limited level, it is impossible to write perfect, mistakes are bound to occur, if you find errors in this book, or more good idea, welcome to give me feedback, I will first give a reply. I will insist on perfect follow-up to this series of articles. I hope the students interested and I finished together.

The creation of this book for the following two purposes:

Dissemination of knowledge, introduce C ++ concurrent programming. Currently no a complete introduction to C ++ 11 concurrent programming books Chinese, I hope this book can help the majority of C ++ developers to learn concurrent programming, reducing the learning curve C ++ concurrent programming, reducing beginner sense of C ++ concurrent programming fears .
Self-motivation and improved. Another purpose of this book is the creation of self-motivation and improved. And like most people, and I was a novice C ++, in the process of creation of this book I will lot of information, a long time, he learned things slowly accumulate more. Meanwhile, at the time of writing for clarity and accuracy, I will continue to refine the individual statements of their own thinking and language skills helpful. Finally, I firmly believe: novice alike (because nothing will), cattle each have their own different.
The book is still in its early works (August 31, 2013 filed the first line), there are a lot of content need to be amended and improved, if you're interested, hoping to add to our team (although there is only me a man fighting alone) together to complete the "C ++ concurrency programming Guide," the dissemination of knowledge for others to improve themselves now.
